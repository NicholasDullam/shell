# Shell
### What is this?
A custom shell, handling custom execution for path management, background processes, subshells, environment variable expansion, piping, redirection, and wildcarding. As a part of CS 252, my shell was built atop C and C++ child processes with integrations for Lex and Yacc to handle parsing and dispatching.
### Getting started
To build both the main and test builds respectively run...
```
make all
```
To clean the repository of compilations run...
```
make clean
```
To run the shell run...
```
./shell
```
